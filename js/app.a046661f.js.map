Developers use them for collaborative development, to ask for code reviews, and to have software-related discussions. In short, a (potential) treasure trove for program comprehension. However, as with any high-throughput \"chat application\", messages interleave, leading to concurrent conversations. Associating messages to conversations is called conversation disentanglement, a useful and necessary pre-processing step to analyze datasets of instant messages. Although various conversation disentanglement algorithms have been proposed, it is cumbersome to set up proper execution environments and hard to ensure input data format consistency, calling for better practices and tool support. <br/><br/> We present CODI, a RESTful API micro-service and web interface for conversation disentanglement. It provides an easy way to disentangle conversation transcripts with pre-trained models or to train new ones on custom datasets, features, and hyper-parameters. CODI allows validation of manually annotated conversations, checks input consistency, and computes performance metrics. It achieves state-of-the-art performances on transcripts of IRC, Slack, and Discord conversations. We show how CODI can provide a significant improvement to reusability (and replicability) of research results, while reducing the efforts and potential mistakes due to configuration, setup, and execution. <br/><br/> Both the report and the poster of my thesis, from which the paper was written from, can be viewed on my GitHub page ([report](https://github.com/edoriggio/edoriggio/blob/master/thesis/report.pdf), [poster](https://github.com/edoriggio/edoriggio/blob/master/thesis/poster.pdf)).',\n        'screenshots': ['assets/projects/codi/codi_1.png', 'assets/projects/codi/codi_2.png', 'assets/projects/codi/codi_3.png', 'assets/projects/codi/codi_4.png'],\n        'technologies': [\n            '**Language:** Python v3.10.0',\n            '**External Libraries:** Django v3.2.5, DjangoRestFramework v3.13.1, Numpy v1.21.5'\n        ],\n        'link': ['https://github.com/USIREVEAL/CODI'],\n        'achievements': ['__February 22, 2023:__ The paper has been accepted in the [ICPC 2023](https://conf.researchr.org/details/icpc-2023/icpc-2023-tool-demonstration/1/Conversation-Disentanglement-As-a-Service)'],\n        'demo': '/codi'\n    },\n    {\n        'title': 'Classical Music',\n        'path': 'classical-music',\n        'category': 'Designflows 2019',\n        'macro_category': 'Competition',\n        'icon': 'assets/competitions/designflows2019.png',\n        'competition': '[Designflows 2019](https://designflows.it/) - Online UI/UX design competition organized by Bending Spoons',\n        'description': 'In this competition, candidates where asked to design an application for people who love music and what to increase their knowledge about the subject.
