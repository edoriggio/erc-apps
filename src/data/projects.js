During the stay, students will have to participate in morning classes at university, followed by evening cultural tours. To facilitate their permanence, I decided to create this application. Being a student of this high school, I lived firsthand this fantastic experience. Although during the visits, I noticed that the culture shock was substantial. Therefore the goal of this application is to make the students prepare for the trip beforehand.',
