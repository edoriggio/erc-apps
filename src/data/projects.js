During the stay, students will have to participate in morning classes at university, followed by evening cultural tours. To facilitate their permanence, I decided to create this application. Being a student of this high school, I lived firsthand this fantastic experience. Although during the visits, I noticed that the culture shock was substantial. Therefore the goal of this application is to make the students prepare for the trip beforehand.',

With this project we tried to combine everything we learned during this course, such as: inheritance, polymorphism, observer patterns, exception handling... This program is a cellular automata which follows the Game of Life rules. In our case, we decided to use Torus rule to manage borders and Moore neighborhood to define the neighbors of a cell.

The terrain is divided into 5 different levels: water, sand, grass, rocks, and snow. The ranges between these level can also be modified by using the \'Water Level\' slider.
