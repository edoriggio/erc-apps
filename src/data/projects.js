During the stay, students will have to participate in morning classes at university, followed by evening cultural tours. To facilitate their permanence, I decided to create this application. Being a student of this high school, I lived firsthand this fantastic experience. Although during the visits, I noticed that the culture shock was substantial. Therefore the goal of this application is to make the students prepare for the trip beforehand.',

The user is asked (if he/she uses the script for the first time) their Instagram username and password, which will then be saved locally in a json file for further reference. It then tries to log in the user\'s Instagram account using Selenium and the Firefox/Chrome driver (In this case drivers for Firefox are used). The script will then prompt the user to input the absolute path of the image they want to check. This can be done in two ways, either by writing down the absolute path of the file, or by dragging and dropping the desired file into the Terminal window. Finally, an image recognition script will begin to run and it will check if the given image is inside the screenshot that was previously taken. The script will then save a .png file in the "Assets" folder containing the screenshot taken earlier and a red square where a possible duplicate was found.',

In this project we decided to create an interactive Java program to simulate the famous John Horton Conway\'s Game of Life. With this project we tried to combine everything we learned during this course, such as: inheritance, polymorphism, observer patterns, exception handling... This program is a cellular automata which follows the Game of Life rules. In our case, we decided to use Torus rule to manage borders and Moore neighborhood to define the neighbors of a cell. Furthermore, because of the design of our program (which makes the most out of OOP and inheritance), it is posible to easily add other kinds of neighborhood and border rules.',

Users can subscribe to the newsletter through a webpage. Here they are requested to input their email address and by clicking on the following field, an overlay appears prompting them to choose from a list of over 200 countries, of which they would like to receive data and news. The countries selected can be more than one, and there is also the possibility to choose the option "World" – so that the user can receive data and news about COVID-19 from all around the world. Once the user has completed the signup process, his job is done. Every day, at around 6pm, an email will be sent automatically to his inbox. The email will contain data regarding the spread of COVID-19 in the selected countries with the aid of graphs, and links to the most recent news articles.
